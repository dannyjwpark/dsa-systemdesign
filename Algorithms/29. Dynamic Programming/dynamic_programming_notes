dynamic programming
  - a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into 
  a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those 
  subproblems just once, and storing their solutions

    - applicable on problems with.. 
      - optimal substructure
        - 
      - overlapping subproblems
        - can be broken down into subproblems when reused several times
        - i.e. Fibonacci sequence

memoization
  - storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the 
  cached result when the same inputs occur again
