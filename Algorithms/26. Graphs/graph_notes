Tree: an undirected graph w/ no cycles
  - connected graph with N nodes & N-1 nodes

Rooted tree: tree with a designated root node where every edge either points away from or towards the root node
  - arborescence (out-tree) : graph where edges point away from the root 
  - anti-arborescence (in-tree) : graph where edges point toward the root

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGS) : directed graphs with no cycles
  - all out-tress are DAGS, but not all DAGs are out-trees

Bipartite Graph: graph whose vertices can be split into 2 independent groups U,V such that every edge connects betweens U and V
  -   graph w/ 2 colorable nodes, or there  is no odd-length cycle

Complete graph: graph w/ a unique ege between every paid of nodes
  - graph w/ n vertices is denoted as the graph Kn 
  - seen as worst type of graph (in performance)
