Approach

1. Everytime a new node is visited, node w/ smallest known distance to visit first is picked/

2. Once moved to the node we are going to visit, look at each of its neighbors

3. For each neighboring node, distance is calculated by summing the total edges 
that lead to the node we're checking from the starting node.

4. If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we 
store the new shorter distance for that node.
